<h2>About</h2>
<p>This software is made freely available with no charge or limitation. 
Even the source is included. 
It was originally distributed as &quot;begware&quot;, promoting my book &quot;The Raider's Lament&quot;. 
I wanted enough downloads/sales to earn enough to buy a Minecraft Lego kit for my daughter. 
The good people of this community helped me reach the target, and a huge shout out to Kahulbane
for donating quite a bit of it! 
So I've now officially considered this software 'paid for' and have removed the begware nagger. 
If you are interested you can still download my book. I'd appreciate it, even more if you read it 
and review it. You can still choose to donate by buying. 
It is available in eBook or Audiobook format.
Further proceeds will go towards buying 
the other Minecraft kits for my daughter! 
Thank you for using and supporting SMEdit.
